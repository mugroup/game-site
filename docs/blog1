Everyone’s favourite dog Toto is running low on pet supplies and needs Dorothy to take the hint that it’s time to go shopping! Dog food, Dog Toys, a new bed, Toto want’s it all but Dorothy has no idea where to find it!  That’s where you come in Bingo Buddies - help Dorothy find these exquisite items on your Bingo cards to make Toto happy (most importantly) but also for a big reward.</p><p class="">We constantly try to push the envelope and bring the best bingo experience we can to our users, which is why we didn’t release this single player collection until it was perfect. In case you missed it, it was National Puppy Day (The best thing to search on twitter) recently, which is when this collection was originally to be released. We’re all very big dog lovers at the office, which may have had an influence on this event, but it really got us thinking about “Man’s best friend” and how fortunate we are to have them in our lives. </p><p class="">If you really think about it, how many tough days have you had, and how many times have you come home from work to see your best friend standing there, ready to snuggle up to you? How many times have you been SUPER bored at home and your best friend was there to play with you? How many happy moments were provided to you thanks to your best friend doing something hilarious?</p><p class="">If it isn’t clear already, the answer is a lot.</p><p class="">Toto was the exact same to Dorothy. In times of struggle, Toto was always there to cheer Dorothy up, and even in the darkest of times was by her side. So let’s give Toto the spotlight he deserves, and the pampering he deserves, and find his pet supplies, shall we?</p>

There’s 2500 easter eggs out there, so be on the lookout when one pops up on your bingo card, and be sure to daub it while you can! </p><p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve been listening to your feedback and we’re glad to say that this new event type should address a need for power ups within the game. We look forward to seeing the success of this event, the impact on our players, and the feedback that comes from it. We appreciate any feedback that is given and we can assure you that it is all read and taken to heart. </p><p>We’re also proud to announce that we’ve ramped up our event production and players should see more events coming their way at a quicker pace! The development team has been working hard to create quality content and we feel we’ve established a library of great events for our players to participate in!

As of Friday, April 12, club sizes in Solitaire Buddies are being reduced from 50 members to 30 members. </p><p>There’s a few reasons why we’ve decided to reduce club sizes, and for those frantically scrambling to see if they have been removed from their club, rest assured that you are safe. Clubs that are currently above 30 members will be unable to add new members to their ranks until they are below the 30 member limit set out today. Now, to get to the heart of the manner, here is our thought process with the reduced team size:</p><p><strong>More Team Cohesion</strong></p><p>I’ve had the privilege of writing Spotlight Sunday posts every two weeks, and the luxury of joining several clubs, from highly competitive to overly casual. I’ve seen many clubs in the game and the one thing ties them all together is the feeling of family. The over-arching support system of clubs has been a very positive impact ton our community, and to heighten this sense of cohesion and bring club members closer together, a smaller club size is needed.</p><p><strong>A More Competitive Club Tournament</strong></p><p>We’ve listened to your call for more competition and we’re here to bring it to fruition. By reducing the club sizes, there will be more competitive clubs competing in the weekly club tournaments. Best of luck, Solitaire Buddies!</p><p><strong>More Fun in Events</strong></p><p>As you may have noticed, we’ve been pushing our live events team to the limit (literally) and bringing you more of the high quality events that you love. By reducing club sizes, our club events will both become more competitive and more fun. Be on the lookout for the next club event - it’s going to be a blast!</p><p><strong>In Short…</strong></p><p>We’ve made the tough decision to reduce club sizes for the greater good. By making this change, we’re bringing you tighter knit social spaces, more competitive weekly tournaments, and more competitive club events. We look forward to seeing your feedback, Solitaire Buddies!</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56df2d3dc2ea517e96e19f02/56df4719e32140863699ed9c/5ca76b861905f4ff5cd9c107/1554912356076/1500w/image+%284%29.png" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1080" height="720"><media:title type="plain">A Letter to Our Clubs</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Becoming the Best in Bingo (Story!)</title><category>Bingo Story</category><dc:creator>Baraphor</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2019 15:50:07 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.clipwiregames.com/blog1/2019/4/2/becoming-the-best-in-bingo-story</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56df2d3dc2ea517e96e19f02:56df4719e32140863699ed9c:5ca3a01f104c7b405a973921</guid><description>It isn’t always what it seems.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s more complex than you think.</p><p>This week in Bingo Story, we introduced a test to find the best of rest, the true standouts, the people who can climb the Bingo Beanstalk the furthest. Many will try, few will succeed, and it will be a welcomed challenge, but when it comes down to it, being the best in bingo is not just about winning our live event. Being the best in bingo is about helping others, being less focused on personal gain, and instead choosing to shift gears to a more selfless perspective.  </p><p>Every day, I log into Bingo Story, collect my daily gifts, and hang out in the chat room to see what’s going on in the community, and every day I’m blown away by the generosity of our players. Every day, without fail, I see at least 10+ occasions where players give spare collection items to others in need. I often say that these are the unsung heroes of our game, as we want Bingo Story to be a place where the community is thriving, a place where kindness prospers and malice fades. This blog post is a big thank you to the players out there who give back to our community, and are always striving to make new players welcomed and valued. The team at Clipwire Games thanks you.</p><p>Of course, never forgotten are the clubs that make the newcomer experience so much better. Being able to talk to thousands of users, it amazes me how frequently clubs are talked about and are described as “families”. We’re so happy to house numerous great clubs with this family-focused mentality and we cannot thank you enough for being supportive to both your fellow players/clubs and newcomers to Bingo Story. This is exactly the kind of support and reaction we wanted when we implemented this club system and we’re happy to see the players come together to achieve greatness (both in the daily tournament and in the community).</p><p>So the next time the best in bingo is talked about, always remember that it isn’t always the winner of competitions or challenges; the best in bingo is often the unsung hero who gives back to their community. The person who treats players with respect and welcome newcomers with open arms. The person who, however small the gesture, brings a little bit of happiness to another’s day. These, in my opinion, are the true players who can be considered the best in bingo.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><p> </p>

It was actually written by an American illustrator by the name of Howard Pyle in 1883, originally entitled, “The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood of Great Renown in Nottinghamshire”. Pyle’s literature dives deep into Robin Hood’s origins, how his band was formed, and the timeless tales of hardship the group had to face, repeatedly, at the hands of the the law-enforcing Sheriff of Nottingham. It’s from tales like these that inspiration is found, often manifesting into written form, but in our case, we decided to go one step further and bring you a complete action-hero inspired collection event. </p><p>For the next few days, Bingo Story, and Sheriff Nottingham will have a case to crack. The local jeweler in town has reported a burglary, but not just any old burglary, as it looks like the thieves have stolen very specific wares. Instead of stealing the items of most value, it looks like the items stolen were items that could be put to good use. It’s almost as if the culprit wanted to use these stolen valuables in their day to day life. At first glance, the Sheriff deduces the culprit must be Robin Hood, as is usually the case, but upon further inspection, a small cutlass was found at the scene. It was at that very moment the Sheriff knew the culprit was unique, not from around the area, and knew how to lie and steal… almost as if it were second nature. One last piece of evidence was scrounged up from the crime scene: a handwritten note, partially destroyed, but made out to seemingly read “ br-ng th- g-ods t- trea—re isl-nd! “.  </p><p>What could this mean? Is there a new threat coming to town? Who were these skilled saboteurs? The Sheriff was going to need help, and he was going to need it fast… and that’s where you come in, Bingo Buddies! The Sheriff is asking for your assistance. Will you let the culprits get away with their petty or crime or become the heroes the Sheriff needs in this defining moment? Be on the look out for stolen treasure on your bingo cards and return them all to the Sheriff for a handsome reward, and who knows, maybe these thieves will turn up as well... </p>

As you may have noticed over the last month, we’ve thrown you a curve ball of our own and stepped up our puzzle game by going into uncharted territory: tales from Poland. The story of the Dragon of Krakow is as fascinating as it is beautiful and there are many renditions available online for you to check out, but for now, enjoy the paraphrased version below.</p><p>The Dragon of Krakow revolves around a king with a big dragon problem he needs solved. After careful deliberation, King Krak issues a challenge to everyone across the kingdom: defeat the Wawel Dragon. Whoever accomplishes this feat earns the right to marry his daughter, Princess Wanda, and earns eternal glory in the form of the king’s scepter and royal crown. Wave after wave of valiant knights came forth, but none could defeat the dragon, until a shoemaker outsmarted everyone and took the well-deserved spoils. </p><p>He’s simply a shoemaker! If knights couldn’t defeat the dragon, how could a simple shoemaker? The answer is easy: chemistry. The shoemaker cleverly stuffed a sheep’s skin with sulphur, pitch, and mustard seed and left the meal until the morning, where the dragon would then be hungry. As planned, the dragon ate the offering in the morning, and a gurgling in his stomach followed by a big BANG decided his fate! Just like that, the Wawel Dragon had been defeated. </p><p>There are many morals we can take away from this story, but our personal favourite is that you don’t need to be the strongest, biggest, toughest person in the world to accomplish great things. Every day at Clipwire Games, there’s a small team of professionals working on bringing you the best bingo experience possible, always looking to accomplish something great. From the team at Clipwire Games, thank you for playing Bingo Story and helping in bringing our passion projects to life. We hope you’ve enjoyed this month’s puzzle set as much as we have, and we look forward to providing you with more tales from Poland in the near future.</p><p>- The Clipwire Games Team</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56df2d3dc2ea517e96e19f02/56df4719e32140863699ed9c/5c74055ff4e1fc9f85c9c2c1/1554491219945/1500w/blog_dragonOfKrakow.png" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="500"><media:title type="plain">The Dragon of Krakow</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Bingo Story 1.9 Patch Notes</title><category>Patch Notes</category><category>Bingo Story</category><dc:creator>Clipwire Games</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2018 18:25:38 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.clipwiregames.com/blog1/2018/11/20/bingo-story-19-patch-notes</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56df2d3dc2ea517e96e19f02:56df4719e32140863699ed9c:5bf45d0d898583ec3be01ce7</guid><description>The one about Gold Tickets.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve listened to your feedback, Bingo Buddies, and after many hours of hard work, we’ve developed our finest patch yet! There are TONS of new features and bug fixes to outline but most importantly, and my personal favourite feature, is the LIVE EVENT SYSTEM coming to Bingo Story! We’ve created a brand-new event system that will introduce community goals, single player collection items, and other bonuses throughout the game. We’ve truly added something for everyone this patch and we believe it’s our strongest one yet. </p><p>In addition to the new events system, we’ve completely updated the user interface of the game to make it easier for you to navigate! We’ve upgraded features like the bingo cards and the daubs to be more clear, concise, and visually pleasant. We didn’t just stop there though, we’ve made the daily spin wheel completely optional and more easily accessible, added a brand-new premium spin wheel for even better prizes, and we’ve vastly improved the player profile to deliver the stats you want to see. We’ve also merged the friends and blocking system to make it easier to find and more efficient for player use AND created a search feature for players to find their friends easier. </p><p>The last portion of the patch is a little bittersweet. We are saying farewell to our ticketing system for bingo cards… on the bright side that means unlimited bingo cards for everyone! We’ve added a spot to trade in any gold tickets that you have for pink tickets - this can be found in the club shop. In it’s place we’ve also delivered a brand-new bingo system that allows for daubing after a bingo has been called on a card. We’ve heard for a while now that users would like to be able to daub after a bingo and we’ve listened and made that a reality!</p><p>For a list of full patch notes, you can see below all the improvements we’ve made this patch, and as always, thank you for your continued support, Bingo Buddies! </p><p>This is Ryan, your favourite Community Manager, signing off!</p><p>-Ryan Golfetto</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><p>BINGO STORY 1.9 PATCH NOTES</p><p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>New live event system that includes community goals, single player collections, and more!</p></li><li><p>Made the daily spin optional and added a premium spin wheel option</p></li><li><p>Removed tickets from the game – no more tickets, unlimited plays!</p></li><li><p>New player profile screen that integrates friends and blocked menus</p></li><li><p>Bingos now have an even more exciting animation</p></li><li><p>Players can now daub on numbers after a bingo has been called </p></li><li><p>Daub icon has been visually improved</p></li><li><p>Players are now able to search for friends!</p></li><li><p>Special Sale icon has been moved for ease of access!</p></li><li><p>Players can now upload their own profile pictures to their player profile!</p></li></ul><p><strong>BUG FIXES</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Various graphics fixes </p></li><li><p>General Bug Fixes</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56df2d3dc2ea517e96e19f02/56df4719e32140863699ed9c/5bf45d0d898583ec3be01ce7/1554491202709/1500w/blog.png" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="500"><media:title type="plain">Bingo Story 1.9 Patch Notes</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Bingo Story 1.8.5 Patch Notes</title><category>Patch Notes</category><category>Bingo Story</category><dc:creator>Baraphor</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2018 19:04:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.clipwiregames.com/blog1/2018/10/2/bingo-story-185-patch-notes</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56df2d3dc2ea517e96e19f02:56df4719e32140863699ed9c:5bb3a98cc83025bada31505e</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Did you miss our blog posts?

When you encounter one of those errors on screen, we need you to send an email to us, including the error message but more importantly what you were doing at the time of the crash as this will make it possible for us to track down the issues.</p><p>As for running WebGL on your computers, running a 64 bit browser is the best way to ensure that the game runs smooth, however we are going to work on making the 32 bit version better as we know this is not an option for everyone. It is also important that you keep your browsers up to date as this will ensure you are getting the latest improvements in performance.</p><p>In addition, the major browser companies are working on new and improved features that will help WebGL games run faster on all browsers, this technology should hopefully be available soon and we will continue to be updating our game with any nessesary changes.</p><p>Finally, we will continue to keep you updated as time goes on with any and all improvements we release.</p><p>TL;DR;</p><ul><li>Upgrade to a 64 bit browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge)</li><li>&nbsp;We are going to continue to release fixes addressing problems</li><li>Submit encountered errors, including what you were doing at the time.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Update:</strong></p><p>I also want to address memory issues, unfortunately as of right now the game requires a significant amount of memory to load, this is because the java script which controls all of the game logic is huge due to the nature of java script and Unity compiling it into a single file. This means the browser needs to load the entire script which requires a lot of memory. There is very little we can do about this at this time. However technologies such as WebAssembly will greatly reduce this and should be available in the near future.</p><p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong></p><p><strong>If you are encountering any issues with running the WebGL version of the game, you first need to make sure that your browser is up to date, this is very important.</strong></p><p><strong>Second if updating your browser did not help, try and switch to a 64 bit browser if possible.</strong></p><p><strong>If neither of these solutions work, please contact us. &nbsp;</strong></p>]]></description><media:content type="image/png" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56df2d3dc2ea517e96e19f02/56df4719e32140863699ed9c/58209684d1758e970307b977/1535481302799/1500w/redshift+image.png" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="800" height="600"><media:title type="plain">Web GL and the Future</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Redshift: 4.3 Patch Notes</title><category>Patch Notes</category><category>Redshift</category><dc:creator>Baraphor</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2016 16:46:04 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.clipwiregames.com/blog1/2016/11/3/redshift-43-patch-notes</link><guid isPermaLink="false">56df2d3dc2ea517e96e19f02:56df4719e32140863699ed9c:581b67ec1b631b221e2b8ced</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: As of this patch we have dropped support for the Unity Web Player, most users should notice no difference as we have been moving people over behind the scenes.

These titles range from beating the Rift, to VIP levels, to Beating Sectors and such. We will also be adding more titles in the future. You can only have one active title at a time and they can set where you change your name.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the titles you can earn</p><ul dir="ltr"><li>Giver of Gifts - Gift 1000 gifts to other players.</li><li>Notable - Reach VIP Level 6.</li><li>Educated - Read the Wiki.</li><li>Prestigious - Have a Level 5 Prestige Ship.</li><li>Redshift Master - Log into the game for 365 days straight.</li><li>Merciless - Kill 1 million enemies.</li></ul><p>We are going to do our best to grant you titles you already may have earned previously, however some titles we cannot grant because we were not storing that information previously.</p><h3>Achievements</h3><p>As I mentioned above, we have added achievements to the game, there are currently 45 you can earn in game, some of which award titles. We will be releasing a full list of achievements at a later date, However you can check out the titles for a glimpse of what some of the achievements are going to be.</p><h3>&nbsp;Skins</h3><p>I alluded to a skinning system last week for ships, You now enter a new screen that allows you to live preview the skin on a ship and select from every skin you have.</p><p>Skins are consumable, which means you need one of a skin for each you have, however a skin can be taken off a ship at any time, and if you burn a skin the skin will also be refunded.</p><p>Currently we have plans for 5 skins, silver, bronze, camouflage, rainbow and polka dot. However we have more skins planned for the future, including unique rewards that can only be earned in the game through completing very difficult tasks. We also can release skins at any time as they are not tied to a patch release, we welcome suggestions for skins as well.</p><h3>Rifts</h3><p>This is a rather large change to the way Rifts currently work in addition to opening up Rift Tier 5. All Rifts are now 10 waves, there are a couple of reasons for this, it can take a long time to complete Rifts currently in many cases and that is not good, we do not want people spending 20, 30, 40 minutes or more to complete a Rift. This means rewards have been adjusted for these Rifts, however the rewards are the same as you would earn in the old longer Rifts for the time invested.</p><p>Second and more importantly, the way rifts are currently designed each Rift is longer than the last and even if we capped the waves at 50 it takes a very long time to design and balance on of these Rifts. By fixing all Rifts at 10 waves we can quickly release new Rifts to provide more of a challenge to later game players.</p><p>That is all for now, there are no pictures as we are still developing some of the features and how they will look. As a side treat we plan to have this patch out next week barring any major issues and the week after that at most. Then we will start on the next major feature which I am really excited about, but you will have to wait until next week to find out more.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/png" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56df2d3dc2ea517e96e19f02/56df4719e32140863699ed9c/573f1f20e707eb90c49339ac/1535483752860/1500w/image+%2813%29.png" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="800" height="600"><media:title type="plain">Feature Friday #13 - Titles and Skins and Rifts!

Now you can take those two Titans and combine them in the Alliance Shipyard using one <strong>Prestige Token</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>What does upgrading this ship actually mean in battle you ask? Well that ship will receive a 25% increase to all core stats including fleet power, damage, plating, speed, attack range, attack frequency, critical hit chance and damage. However besides the <strong>Prestige Token</strong>, the new ship will be level 1 again and have to be leveled up again.</p><p>And wait there is more, you can take two prestige level one ships and combine them into a prestige level two ship and on forever, there &nbsp;is not max prestige level.</p><p>We will be releasing more information about this system over the coming weeks before it's release as well as some other features.</p><p>As a treat here is a WIP screenshot of the new UI for the Shipyard.</p><p> </p>
